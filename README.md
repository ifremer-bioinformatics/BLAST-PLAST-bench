# Benchmarks of BLAST and PLAST

This project provides scripts to run benchmarks of BLAST and PLAST on a supercomputer infrastructure.

Provided scripts were designed to run comparison softwares on IFREMER's DATARMOR computer providing PBS job sceduler system. However, it would be easy to adapt thses scripts to run with other kind of job schedulers.
